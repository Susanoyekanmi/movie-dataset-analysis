# movie-dataset-analysis( a movie dataset containing records of movie produced from 1966-2015)


# This project was carried to help production companies make important and successful decision towards movie production 

I started this by importing necessary libraries like pandas,bumpy,seaborn

loaded the dataset with the panda functions,assessed dataset visually and programmatically using .head(),describe,etc

cleaned the dataset by dealing with both quality and tidiness issues

To avoid confusion,I separated and exploded the 'genres' column  to remove the '|' separator 

some questions answered include 

Which genres are most popular from year to year,
Movie with highest profit and lowest profit,
Movies with highest and low budget,
Movies with highest and low revenueDoes the budget of a movie determine its profit,
What kinds of properties are associated with movies that have high revenues?,
By what factor would revenue increase with an increase in profit,
By what factor would profit increase with an increase in popularity, etc
